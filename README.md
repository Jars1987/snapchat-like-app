# Snapchat Like App

In this project I followed along an online turtorial and made the changes I
found necessary when debuging the app.

## App short description:

You can login with google authentication.

Take a snapshot.

On the chat screen you will see the list of users and their snapshots.

Red square means the photo as not been seen.

Select the chat with a screen and you will be present with the image.

You can cick the image to exit or will be foward back to the chatscreen after 10
seconds

(tracked by react-countdown-circle-timer)

Images can only been seen once and after being seen red square disapears

Simple and fun.

It was fun to learn to use react-webcam.

See you in the next build.
